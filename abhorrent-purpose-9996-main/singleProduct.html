        <h5>Exploring a destination...</h5>
        <p>
          The joy of travel comes in exploring new things. Planting your feet
          somewhere you’ve never been before brings with it the rush of
          discovery and the joy of pushing back on the boundaries of your world.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when one does arrive at that fresh frontier, there are ways better
          than others to begin your journey of discovery. Follow these steps and
          see the world with a new light.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Discover a new city through a food tour. Food tour’s are the easiest
          way to take a tour, learn about the local delicacies, and the best of
          all, get great tips that aren’t just “local” tips for tourists, but
          sometimes, lessons for a lifetime too
        </p>
        <p>
          • Use Public Transportation. When you are in a new city, you can
          possibly see places and people that you wouldn’t normally see when
          simply walking to the places that checks your list. Some buses or
          rails take you to parts of the city you wouldn’t get to see otherwise.
          Whilst using public transportation, just ensure that you are following
          the local norms and do remember to watch the locals!
        </p>
        <p>
          • Find a local festival. Go beyond what other tourists might do while
          visiting a place. Look for the unique things you would want to do. Use
          social media or the local tourism website to find out what’s going on
          locally. You may have to move out of the center of the city to do some
          of the less popular but more unique things, so just keep that in mind!

          <h3>How to choose a destination to travel to?</h3>
          Travelling is exhilarating - and a little bit intimidating too. You
          are venturing into the unknown and you really have very little ideas
          about what things will be like there when you arrive. It's always a
          massive learning curve when you leap into the new (which is why it's
          important to thoroughly research a travel destination before you go.)
          Some of the important things to keep in mind while deciding on a
          destination to travel are :
          <li>
            Figure out how to travel to a destination, where to stay and what
            are the things to do amongst other things. Trip Ideas by MakeMyTrip
            brings you a plethora of knowledge about a destination ranging from
            images and videos to lists of all the activities
          </li>
          <li>
            Read posts by travel bloggers who have been there and if needed
            email them
          </li>
          <li>
            Watch documentaries and reach out to people who have been there
          </li>
        </div>

        <div id="self">
          <h3>How to explore a place by yourself?</h3>
          "Adventure is out there!" - You just need to know the 'whats' and the
          'hows' of it. You need to realize the things that will make exploring
          a place completely worthwhile and satisfy all of your travel cravings.
          This can be achieved by -
          <li>Taking Yourself Out To Eat At A Restaurant</li>
          <li>Learn The Public Transportation Routes</li>
          <li>Check Out A Local Planetarium Or Observatory</li>
          <li>Take A Drive To The Nearest Coastal Town Or National Park</li>
          <li>Join A Group Of Tourists On A Sightseeing Tour</li>
          <li>Take Pictures At A Botanical Garden</li>
          <li>Go Shopping At A Local Farmers Market</li>
